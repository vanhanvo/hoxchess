_HOXChess_ is an _open source_ [Xiangqi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi) (aka. Chinese Chess) client, capable of working with multiple online Xiangqi sites. It is a _traditional desktop_ application, mainly developed in C++ using [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org) library.

### Key Goals ###

  * _Documentation_ - Providing extensive documentation on how to build and and improve the project.
  * _Reusability_ - Seeking to build the project based on the list of _core_ components that can be used in _projects other than_ HOXChess.

### Help Needed ###

  * **_HOXChess needs your help!_** - No great application can be built by one.
  * If you would like to join the effort, please contact me at _huyphan@playxiangqi.com_
